About 10% of the webhooks we've implemented missed critical information in their docs â€” including lack of the encoding format (base64 or hex), the signature date format (Unix or RFC 3339), and hash signature payload instructions. To overcome incomplete docs, we spent significant time performing guess work, scraping the internet, and unit testing webhooks until finding something that made sense. While we were motivated to continue digging and researching to get the correct answer, many developers would have skipped verifying webhooks out of frustration."]}],"frontmatter":{"title":"Documentation","description":"Documentation"},"file":{"path":"/ops-experience/documentation.md"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
