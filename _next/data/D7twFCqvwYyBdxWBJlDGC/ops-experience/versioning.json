In its initial version (v1), Hubspot signed only the webhook request body to validate calls. Over the years, Hubspot improved its webhooks to include timestamp validation, changed the webhook signature contents, and changed the encoding from hex to base64.  By informing the webhook signature version to the listener (via a header value or within the signed message), Hubspot made forward compatibility possible without breaking legacy endpoints. The versioning also allowed Hubspot to rollout webhook improvements per event basis, reducing the migration complexity for both provider and consumers."]}],"frontmatter":{"title":"Forward Compatibility and versioning","description":"Providing forward compatibility"},"file":{"path":"/ops-experience/versioning.md"}}},"__N_SSG":true}
