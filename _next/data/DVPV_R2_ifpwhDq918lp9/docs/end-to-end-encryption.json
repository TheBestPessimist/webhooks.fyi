With mTLS, both webhook service and listener apps pass through a TLS handshake — in which each system is required to authenticate with their certificates — before the webhook message is sent. This method delivers a stronger authentication between the webhook service and listener, ensures communication confidentiality (the webhook message is sent only after both sides are authenticated), and both integrity and non-repudiation (when combined with webhook signatures)."]},{"$$mdtype":"Tag","name":"Fence","attributes":{"language":"mermaid"},"children":["sequenceDiagram\n  Webhook Service->Listening App: Initiate mTLS handshake\n  Note over Webhook Service,Listening App: Both Webhook Service and Listening App go through the Mutual TLS authentication\n  Note left of Webhook Service: Create webhook message\n  Note left of Webhook Service: Generate signature hash of the message body with the shared secret\n  Webhook Service->>+Listening App: Send Webhook notification\n  Note right of Listening App: Generate signature hash of the message body with the shared secret\n  Note right of Listening App: Validate signature hash vs the value sent by the webhook service\n  Note right of Listening App: Process webhook call\n  Listening App-->>-Webhook Service: Return response.\n"]},{"$$mdtype":"Tag","name":"p","attributes":{},"children":["_Mutual TLS with request signature validation _"]},{"$$mdtype":"Tag","name":"p","attributes":{},"children":["However, mTLS is often difficult to configure.
